# IMR_rshiny
demo of rshiny with WHO data
This file downloads infant mortality data and health worker data from the WHO site. It then reduces the raw data down to a dense matrix. No
summarization or enrichment is done. The data is plotted and a fit is overlaid. Dragging boxes around the points shows the raw tabular data.
